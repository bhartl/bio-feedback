# Bio-feedback examples

In this sub-directory of the `bio-feedback` project we collect example usage of the code.

- In the `notebooks` folder, you find 'jupyter-notebooks' which can be used for device-data **visualization** and for **data-analysis**
- In the `controller` folder, some simple **Agent**s are implemented which allow (i)  playing sound **using the keyboard** or (ii) playing recordings located in the `<PROJECT_ROOT>/data` folder.
- In the `pipeline` folder, `Receiver` and `Transmitter` examples are implemented to demonstrate life-data acquisition via the *Lab Streaming Layer*, using the `pylsl` and the `biofb` framework.
