""" Bio-controller audio-controller module with spoken controller recorded from experts in the field of hypnosis (e.g., Thomas Hill (TH)).

Spoken controller signals can directly connect with our emotions and moreover can connect with our audio complex in our brain.
By `saying` the correct things at the correct moment, participants in a relaxed state can be destabilized enough to deepen their hypnotic experience (according to TH and Raphael Biancale).

Such an approach is more direct than using controller sounds, since we can rely on the experience of the recorded person.
Tests can be pipeline where the controller (in person) selects what would come next and a model might be used to `fit` this reasoning.
